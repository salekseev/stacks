# Portainer Stacks Collection - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A comprehensive collection of Docker Compose stacks designed for deployment via Portainer, focusing on home automation, media streaming, and infrastructure services. The project provides ready-to-deploy configurations for essential home lab services with emphasis on performance, reliability, and ease of management.

## Core Services Portfolio

### Media & Streaming Services
- **Plex Media Server**: Full-featured media server with NVIDIA GPU transcoding support for efficient video processing
- **Go2RTC**: Advanced WebRTC streaming service with hardware acceleration and custom networking for real-time media streaming

### Home Automation & Smart Home
- **Scrypted**: Comprehensive smart home platform with NVIDIA GPU support, automatic updates via Watchtower, and extensive device compatibility
- **Z-Wave JS UI**: Modern Z-Wave device management interface for smart home integration and device control

### Monitoring & Utilities
- **Change Detection**: Automated web page monitoring service with Playwright-powered Chrome browser for dynamic content detection
- **iPerf3**: Network performance testing and bandwidth measurement tools for infrastructure validation
- **Ser2Net**: Serial-to-network converter for legacy device integration

### Browser Automation Infrastructure
- **Playwright Chrome**: Headless browser service optimized for automation tasks with configurable concurrency and resource management

## Technical Architecture

### Hardware Optimization
- NVIDIA GPU integration across media and AI-powered services (Plex, Go2RTC, Scrypted)
- Custom networking configurations with IPVLAN support for advanced network isolation
- Hardware device passthrough for USB, Z-Wave, and serial devices

### Deployment Strategy
- Portainer-native stack deployment with Git repository integration
- Centralized environment variable management via stack.env
- Consistent container naming and networking conventions
- Automated update mechanisms where appropriate (Watchtower for Scrypted)

### Security & Reliability
- AppArmor configurations for enhanced container security
- Restart policies optimized for service availability
- Resource reservations and limits for stable performance
- Proper timezone and user permissions management

2. Consistent volume mounting strategies
3. Network configuration templates
4. Device passthrough documentation
5. Security baseline configurations

### Service Integration
1. Inter-service communication patterns
2. Dependency management between stacks
3. Shared volume and network configurations
4. Load balancing and reverse proxy integration
5. SSL/TLS certificate management

### Testing & Validation
1. Service health check implementations
2. Integration testing procedures
3. Performance benchmarking tools
4. Backup and recovery procedures
5. Migration and upgrade testing

### Infrastructure Management
1. Resource monitoring and alerting
2. Log aggregation and analysis
3. Backup automation
4. Disaster recovery procedures
5. Capacity planning guidelines

## Success Criteria
