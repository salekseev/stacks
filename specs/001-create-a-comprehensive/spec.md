# Feature Specification: Media Automation Stack with Secure Remote Access and Automated Settings Synchronization

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-comprehensive`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a comprehensive media automation stack using Starr apps, download clients, a Cloudflare tunnel for secure remote access, and `recyclarr` for automated settings synchronization. The implementation will be a single Docker Compose file with a dedicated network, and all environment variables will be managed in the central `stacks/stack.env` file. Container images will be sourced primarily from official images or `hotio.dev` (where available) and `ghcr.io` (prioritized over Docker Hub) and pinned to specific semantic versions for stability. The stack will use shared media and configuration paths consistent with the existing `plex` stack (`/mnt/dpool/media` and `/mnt/spool/apps/config`).

Starr applications: Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr.
Usenet download client: Sabnzbd.
Torrent download client: qBittorrent.
Supporting services: Flaresolverr and Unpackerr."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn‚Äôt apply, remove it entirely (don‚Äôt leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you‚Äôd need to make
2. **Don‚Äôt guess**: If the prompt doesn‚Äôt specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a media administrator, I want an integrated, reliable system to automatically discover, acquire, and organize requested TV episodes and movies from multiple sources, keep application settings consistent across components, and allow secure remote management so that my media library stays complete and tidy with minimal manual effort.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Automated acquisition on request**  
   Given a new movie or series request is added, when the system processes the request, then it locates a matching release according to configured quality and language preferences, acquires it via an available source, and imports it into the library with correct naming and folder structure.
2. **Ongoing series monitoring**  
   Given a tracked series has upcoming or newly released episodes, when new episodes become available, then the system discovers, acquires, and imports them automatically without manual action.
3. **Secure remote administration**  
   Given an authorized administrator is off the home network, when they open the management UIs via the approved secure tunnel entrypoint, then all UIs load and function without exposing direct service ports to the public internet.
4. **Consistent settings synchronization**  
   Given shared profiles and settings are defined once centrally, when synchronization runs, then Sonarr, Radarr, and related components reflect those settings consistently without drift.
5. **Robust extraction and import**  
   Given acquired content is compressed or multi-part, when downloads complete, then archives are correctly extracted and verified, and the final media files are imported; if errors occur, the system reports and retries according to policy.

### Edge Cases
- Indexer or provider outage results in temporary acquisition failures ‚Üí system retries with backoff and surfaces the issue to the admin.
- Download client is unreachable ‚Üí requests are queued; user is notified with recovery guidance.
- Insufficient disk space ‚Üí queue pauses safely and alerts the admin; no data corruption.
- Duplicate or inferior-quality releases ‚Üí system prevents duplicates and prefers the best release per policy.
- Mislabelled content or wrong language ‚Üí system flags items for manual review with clear remediation steps.
- Remote access tunnel outage ‚Üí management UIs are unavailable externally but remain accessible locally; system status indicates degraded remote access.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Admin MUST be able to request movies and series and manage monitored items.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST discover content via multiple index sources and handle temporary outages gracefully.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST acquire content via at least one Usenet and one BitTorrent client, using policies to choose sources.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST import completed downloads into the library with correct naming, folders, and metadata alignment.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST enforce quality, language, and upgrade policies for both initial grabs and post-import upgrades.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST extract and verify archives and handle multi-part/compressed releases.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST re-try failed downloads with bounded backoff and surface actionable error messages.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST support manual override for matching, import, and quality decisions.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide secure remote access to all admin UIs without exposing direct service ports to the public internet.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST synchronize shared settings and profiles across applications from a single source of truth on a scheduled or on-demand basis.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide health/diagnostics views indicating component status and key errors.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST maintain audit logs of administrative actions and remote access events. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period and storage location]
- **FR-013**: The system MUST support notifications on key events (failures, successful imports, upgrades). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification channels]
- **FR-014**: The system MUST ensure imported media is discoverable by the existing media server without additional manual steps.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST avoid duplicate imports and support safe re-processing when files are replaced or upgraded.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST allow safe, reversible configuration changes with rollback of settings if needed.

### Non-Functional Requirements (constraints & qualities)
- **NFR-001**: Secure remote access MUST use the approved zero-trust tunnel approach (Cloudflare Tunnel as specified by stakeholders) and require authentication.
- **NFR-002**: No direct inbound exposure of service ports to the public internet; all external access flows through the secure tunnel.
- **NFR-003**: A single, centralized configuration source MUST define environment variables and shared settings to minimize drift.
- **NFR-004**: The solution MUST integrate with the existing media library storage and configuration store locations already in use, without disrupting current organization.
- **NFR-005**: The system SHOULD support straightforward backup/restore of all application configurations and profiles. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backup frequency and location]
- **NFR-006**: The solution SHOULD provide clear operational runbooks for start/stop, upgrade, and recovery. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: RTO/RPO targets]
- **NFR-007**: The system SHOULD expose health/readiness indicators suitable for monitoring. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: monitoring destination]

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Media Request**: A user-initiated desire to acquire a movie or series/episode; includes title identifiers, language, quality preferences.
- **Indexer**: A searchable catalog used to discover available releases; includes connectivity state and quotas.
- **Download Client**: A service that acquires a selected release; includes queue, job state, and error conditions.
- **Download Job**: A specific acquisition instance with lifecycle from queued ‚Üí downloading ‚Üí completed/failed ‚Üí imported.
