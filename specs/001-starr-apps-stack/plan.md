# Implementation Plan: Starr Apps Media Stack

**Branch**: `001-starr-apps-stack` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-starr-apps-stack/spec.md`

## Summary
The feature involves creating a comprehensive media automation stack using Starr apps, download clients, a Cloudflare tunnel for secure remote access, and `recyclarr` for automated settings synchronization. The implementation will be a single Docker Compose file with a dedicated network, and all environment variables will be managed in the central `stacks/stack.env` file. Container images will be sourced primarily from `hotio.dev` (where available) and `ghcr.io` (prioritized over Docker Hub) and pinned to specific semantic versions for stability. The stack will use shared media and configuration paths consistent with the existing `plex` stack (`/mnt/dpool/media` and `/mnt/spool/apps/config`).

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: `YAML (Docker Compose)`
**Primary Dependencies**: `Docker Compose`
**Storage**: `Docker Volumes`
**Testing**: `docker-compose config`, manual testing
**Target Platform**: `Linux with Docker`
**Project Type**: `single project`
**Performance Goals**: `N/A`
**Constraints**: `N/A`
**Scale/Scope**: `~9 services`

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes, each stack is a self-contained unit.
- Libraries listed: Starr Apps Stack
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? N/A
- Git commits show tests before implementation? N/A
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? N/A
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. N/A

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes, via `docker-compose logs`
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? N/A
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

## Project Structure

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `tasks.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- The tasks have been generated in `tasks.md`.
- The tasks are ordered logically, starting with the creation of the main `docker-compose.yaml` file, followed by the addition of each service, and concluding with documentation and testing.

**Estimated Output**: ~13 tasks.
