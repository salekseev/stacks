# Feature Specification: Starr Apps Media Stack

**Feature Branch**: `001-starr-apps-stack`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'd like to create stacks containing Starr apps, like sonarr, radarr, prowlarr, flaresolver, unpackerr on a dedicated docker network. Then add usenet client sabnzbd and torrent client qbittorrent. All of them would be externalized via cloudflared tunnel so I'd need to add a stack for that too and connect it to the starr media network."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a self-hosting user, I want to deploy a comprehensive, automated media server using popular Starr applications (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr), download clients (Sabnzbd, qBittorrent), and supporting services (Flaresolverr, Unpackerr), all running on a dedicated, isolated network and securely accessible from the internet via a Cloudflare Tunnel.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the complete set of stacks is deployed, **When** I access the Sonarr web UI via its secure tunnel endpoint, **Then** I can add and manage TV series.
2. **Given** a new movie is added in the Radarr UI, **When** the system searches for releases, **Then** it successfully sends the download request to either Sabnzbd or qBittorrent.
3. **Given** a download completes in Sabnzbd or qBittorrent, **When** the files are processed, **Then** Unpackerr automatically extracts the contents.
4. **Given** the stacks are running, **When** I access the Prowlarr UI, **Then** I can configure and sync indexers to the other Starr apps.
5. **Given** a site requires it, **When** a Starr app queries an indexer, **Then** Flaresolverr resolves any challenges to allow the request to succeed.
6. **Given** the Cloudflared stack is configured correctly, **When** I navigate to the designated public URLs, **Then** I can access the web UIs for Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Sabnzbd, and qBittorrent.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Cloudflare Tunnel service (`cloudflared`) fails to start or connect?
- How does the system behave if a download client (e.g., Sabnzbd) is offline but a Starr app tries to send a download request to it?
- What is the recovery process if a container's configuration is invalid and it enters a crash loop?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a Docker Compose stack for the core Starr applications: Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a Docker Compose stack for the Usenet download client: Sabnzbd.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a Docker Compose stack for the torrent download client: qBittorrent.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide Docker Compose stacks for the supporting services: Flaresolverr and Unpackerr.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a Docker Compose stack for the Cloudflared tunnel service.
- **FR-006**: All specified services MUST be configured to run on a single, user-defined Docker network named `starr_media_network`.
- **FR-007**: The Cloudflared service MUST be connected to the `starr_media_network` to enable routing to the other services.
- **FR-008**: Each service's configuration (e.g., ports, volumes, environment variables) MUST be clearly defined within its respective stack file.
- **FR-009**: The solution MUST allow for persistent data storage for all services using Docker volumes.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST be configurable to allow users to set their own tunnel credentials and other sensitive information via environment variables.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide a Docker Compose stack for Recyclarr to automate the synchronization of settings between Radarr and Sonarr.

### Key Entities
- **Starr App**: A service for managing media collections (e.g., Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr).
- **Download Client**: A service responsible for downloading files from the internet (e.g., Sabnzbd, qBittorrent).
- **Supporting Service**: A utility that provides a specific function for other services (e.g., Flaresolverr for bypassing challenges, Unpackerr for extraction).
- **Tunnel Service**: The Cloudflared container that exposes the internal services to the internet securely.
- **Media Network**: The isolated Docker network (`starr_media_network`) that connects all the services.
